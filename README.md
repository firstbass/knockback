The basic theme for this project is "enemies are weapons."

This uses the programming language Lua, with the libraries TEsound and LÖVE.

The round function was retrieved from http://lua-users.org/wiki/SimpleRound.
Kevin MacLeod's Pixel Peeker Polka, Vernon Adams' font Oxygen Mono, and Nick Curtis' font DayPosterBlack are also used.
